# WSD-project
Link to a project website for Aalto Web Software Development course. The project was created according to the instructions given at the WSD course. The front-end was created using Eta-templates. Backend was created with Deno and routed with Oak. The database used is PostgreSQL.


This is a web-application that can be used for creating and answering questions. The application can be tested in https://wsd-project-ii.herokuapp.com/ .
The front-end was developed and tested using Google Chrome. One of the front-end libraries has a bug with Firefox, so email validation at registration does not work correctly for Firefox. (One must use a valid format email)
